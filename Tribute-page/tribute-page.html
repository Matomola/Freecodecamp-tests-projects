         <ul>
           <li>Before the incident—before his body became a battleground for competing poisons and his story the subject of zoological curiosity—Jeremy Sutcliffe had actually liked snakes. He’d found them beautiful, even.</li>
           <li>Besides, the tattooed 40-year-old wasn’t someone who shied away from wild creatures.</li>
           <li>He was an avid outdoorsman who took every chance he could to camp and fish.</li>
           <li>That love of nature had been part of the reason Jeremy and his wife Jennifer, 43, had recently moved to South Texas from Kansas. The place they’d bought on Lake Corpus Christi, a short drive from the Gulf of Mexico, was their dream home.</li>
           <li>At the moment, they were living in a trailer on their one-acre lot, and the house was still a fixer-upper.</li>
           <li>On a steamy Sunday morning in May 2018, the couple was tidying their yard in preparation for an evening cookout with their daughter and her two young children. At around 10:30 a.m., Jeremy began mowing the lawn while Jennifer worked on the garden.</li>
           <li>She had just reached down to grab a weed when she saw it: a western diamondback rattlesnake, right next to her hand.</li>
           <li>Jennifer leaped up as the snake, a meter long, rose into a striking position, with its dusty triangular head tensed and its tail rattling. “Snake!” yelled Jennifer as she backed away.</li>
           <li>When he heard his wife’s cry, Jeremy figured she’d run into one of the harmless rat snakes that often showed up on the property.</li>
           <li>He grabbed a shovel to shoo the creature away and jogged around the house to the garden. That’s when he heard the rattling.</li>
           <li>His wife was cornered between some shrubbery and the wall of the house, the snake directly in her path.</li>
           <li>He first tried to scoop up the rattler using the shovel, without success.</li>
           <li>Then he did what was necessary: He raised the garden tool and brought the edge down hard through the snake’s body just below the head, decapitating it.</li>
           <li>Jennifer went into the house, her heart hammering, while Jeremy headed back to the garden.</li>
           <li>About ten minutes later, when Jennifer said she was going to let their two small dogs out, he decided to move the dead reptile.</li>
           <li>He looked at the creature lying limp on the ground. Its head, attached to a stub of body, rested on a paving stone.</li>
           <li>He bent down to pick up a stick lying next to the snake’s head so that he could flick it away.</li>
           <li>But before his hand even touched the ground, the snake attacked—a blur of motion as the creature launched itself forward.</li>
           <li>Burying its fangs into Jeremy’s right hand down to the bone, the snake injected venom that immediately made his hand feel like it had been smashed by a massive weight. “It bit me!” he yelled in horror.</li>
           <li>For Jeremy, it was like something out of a zombie movie—an undead creature’s final act of revenge: But the truth is, bites from decapitated snakes aren’t uncommon.</li>
           <li>It’s like a chicken with its head cut off, only with a much longer survival time because it’s a cold-blooded reptile with a slow metabolism.</li>
           <li>In that moment, however, all Jeremy was thinking about was that the snake that he’d killed was now trying to kill him.</li>
           <li>The creature’s jaws were clamped around his hand.</li>
           <li>Desperate to free himself, Jeremy inserted the fingers of his left hand beneath the snake’s upper jaw and tried to pry the fangs free.</li>
           <li>He managed to remove one of the fangs from his middle finger, but as he tried to pull the head loose, the viper’s jaw clenched again, burying the fang in his ring finger this time.</li>
         </ul>
